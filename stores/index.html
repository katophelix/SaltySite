                    <p>The Salty Dog T-Shirt Factory at 67 Arrow Road carries our full line of Salty Dog gear. This is the
                        store where all the magic happens! Many folks visit Arrow Road just to see our twelve-color, robotic
                        printing press in action. You can even watch our shirts being printed through a custom window. Printing
                        times may vary, but it’s worth the trip just to see where your Salty Dog T-Shirt’s life begins! While
                        visiting, make sure to say, “hello” to our resident macaws! Red Bird, Green Bean and Cosmo might
                        just say, “hello,” back! All of the Arrow Road birds can talk, just not always when you’re looking!
                        You may also hear our smart and talkative African Grey, Remy, from our indoor aviary. She prefers
                        a bit more solitude, but is joined by the other three birds at night.

                        to the South Beach Inn is Jake’s Cargo. Jake’s Cargo is a bit bigger than the T-Shirt Shop, so in
                        addition to all of the T-shirt styles you’ll find all kinds of other Salty Dog gear, especially for
                        your pets. Collars, leashes, toys, bandanas and more are sure to satisfy even the pickiest pets.
                        Jake’s Cargo is also the full time home of Captain and Cherokee, the feathered friends that hang
                        out in the courtyard trees during the day. Captain is a scarlet macaw who likes peanuts and seeing
                        all the smiling faces at South Beach. Cherokee, a blue and gold macaw, is the youngest of the bunch
                        and loves apples and other fresh fruit. </p>
