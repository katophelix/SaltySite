                        <p>Often times we hear the question: “Why do I have to pay to enter Sea Pines and visit South
                            Beach?”
                            There’s an easy answer – the $8 fee (cash only) goes into the general operating fund of The
                            Sea Pines
                            Community Services Association and represents a significant contribution to the general
                            operation
                            and upkeep of Sea Pines. Here is a brief history of Sea Pines and the gate fee:.</p>

                        <p>Sea Pines is a private community located at the south end of Hilton Head Island. Sea Pines
                            was founded
                            in 1956 by Charles Fraser. Fraser envisioned Sea Pines as the coexistence of commercial and
                            business
                            operations alongside residential and vacation homes. Sea Pines Plantation, as it was
                            originally conceived,
                            offered homes that blended with &amp; complimented their natural surroundings. These homes
                            were situated
                            around commercial enterprises such as marinas, golf courses, tennis courts, &amp; swimming
                            pools
                            along with shopping and dining venues. By design, Mr. Fraser incorporated Sea Pines as a
                            private
                            community in charge of all operations of the infrastructure. His new community was
                            self-sufficient
                            and did not receive the benefit of public funds or tax dollars. The roadways, the security
                            force,
                            grounds maintenance, etc. were (and still are) funded by residential &amp; commercial
                            property owner
                            assessments and contributions. Additionally, a security gate was erected at both entrances
                            and visitors
                            would be charged a fee for their vehicles to enter Sea Pines.</p>

                        <p>Today, gate fee dollars are earmarked for the operation of the community and help to fund
                            items such
                            as the maintenance of the roadways, the security force and the trolley operations. So, as
                            you drive
                            through Sea Pines, please enjoy our unique community and know that the gate fee helps keep
                            Sea Pines
                            safe and beautiful. Thank you for visiting!</p>
